BuildFixes
==========
Minecraft building tweaks and fixes!<br/>
<br/>
<i>BuildFixes alters a number of mechanics (such as physics) to allow it's users to build more creatively 
and naturally with blocks that could previously only be used via plugins like Voxel Sniper or WorldEdit!</i><br/>
<br/>

Features:
- Block dragon egg interactions!
- Place powered redstone lamps (no need to leave unsightly levers etc on there!)
- Place half-doors
- Place 'special logs' (with tree-bark on all sides)
- Add NoPhysics properties to any block ID!
- Command to give user a variety of blocks that are otherwise missing from creative inventories
- Admin commands to configure plugin settings in-game<br/>
- Restrict environmental effects such as weather, block decays/forms
<br/>
<br/>

Commands:<br/>
- <b>'/get [egg], [doors], [furnace], [logs], [lamps], [slabs #0-15]'</b> - gives user the various type of special blocks
